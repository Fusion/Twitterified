	 * This is a base class of an Iterative Layouting algorithm. Unlike one
	 * pass algorithms with performs animation to reach to a final drawing, 
	 * an iterative algorithm has several steps that are not pre-determined
	 * and are required to be taken until the graph 'stabilizes'.
	 * 
	 * By definition, there could be many steps involved so the goal is to:
	 * (a) report measure of stability - update the user about the developments
	 * (b) faster computation steps - less time spent before every refresh
	 * (c) responsive UI - not to freeze the interface during computation
